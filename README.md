# Scene View Bookmarks

Unity editor extension that adds scene view bookmarks, allowing you to quickly
return the scene camera to preset positions.

Inspired by [camera bookmarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i-d5OZmhWI) in
Unreal Engine.


## Requirements

Unity 2019.4 or later. The scene overlay only appears in 2021.2 and up.


## Installing

Add the package to your project via
[UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) using the Git URL:

```
https://github.com/mminer/scene-view-bookmarks.git
```

1. Open the Package Manager window in Unity (*Window > Package Manager*)
2. Click the "+" button in the top-left corner
3. Select "Install package from git URL..."
4. Enter the above Git URL
5. Click "Install"

Alternatively, add the following line to your `Packages/manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.matthewminer.scene-view-bookmarks": "https://github.com/mminer/scene-view-bookmarks.git",
    ...
  }
}
```

You can also clone the repository and point UPM to your local copy.


## Using

Choose *Window > Scene View Bookmarks > Set Bookmark 1* to save the scene
camera's current position. When you want to return to the view that you
bookmarked, choose *Window > Move to Bookmark 1*.

For faster access press <kbd>option / alt</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> to save a bookmark
then <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> to return to it.

After recalling a bookmark, restore the former scene view using *Window > Scene
View Bookmarks > Return to Previous View* or by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd>
<kbd>0</kbd>. Think of this as an undo of sorts.

### Scene Overlays

If you use 2021.2 or later you can access bookmarks from a dropdown in the Scene
window. Click the â‹® button in the top-right of the window and choose *Overlays >
Scene View Bookmarks*.

### Search

Use the `svb:` filter in Unity's built-in Search window for yet another way to
access bookmarks.
